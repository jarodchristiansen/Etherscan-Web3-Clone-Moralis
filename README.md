# Etherscan-Web3-Clone-Moralis
Functional clone of Etherscan site to monitor the Ethereum blockchain, created utilizing Moralis Web3 development framework, and Javascript as part of broader web3 coursework.

## Further Integration
This project is easily extensible into additional projects as it applies the traditional connection to the Ethereum blockchain utilziing Moralis and real-time data analysis. 
Codebase is currently being extended into TokenWatch NextJS project to aide in monitoring blockchain data, as well as metamask integration for trades.
